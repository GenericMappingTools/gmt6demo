# GMT6 Demo: Modern mode and subplots

The demo runs on a [Jupyter notebook](http://jupyter.org) using `%%bash` cells
and `IPython.display.Image` to insert the generated plots in the notebook.

You can try it online (no install required) at http://gmt6demo.gmtpython.xyz

The online demo runs on [mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org/).

To run it locally, you'll need the [Anaconda Python
distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/download/).
After installing it, grab an archive of this repository and unzip it (or clone
it to your machine).
Inside the unzipped repository, run the following in your terminal:

    conda env create
    source activate gmt6demo
    jupyter notebook

This should open you browser to the Jupyter notebook interface. Select
`demo.ipynb` and run the code using `Shift+Enter`.
